## Project Sought
  * I am looking for a challenging project that is unique and different from the typical web-application product.
  All of my silly side-project ideas are all web-applications, so that is why I would rather focus on something else.
  The project can be research oriented or product based. I'm open to embedded, networking, cyber-security, or theoretical projects (anything really). 
  I would love to work in a team as well. Last note - I am down to spend a lot of my own time into this project because I am living at
  my mom's house this year and don't have much to do.
