## Professional Biography
> In my professional experience I have worked for a company called Siemens Digital Industries Software.
> During my time here, I have worked for a few different teams. On my first team I developed a log
> pipeline using AWS services combined with ELK stack to create an easy to read log dashboard as well
> as implement Tensorflow machine learning models to analyze log files and report errors either before
> or as they occur. With my next team I worked on developing a web application using Angular JS and 
> running automated tests using Selenium and Specflow. For my most recent team I was doing research
> and development, I developed a Tensorflow model creation pipeline that I used to create object 
> detection models that could be ran on small pieces of hardware like the Google Glass. I then
> developed two Android applications for the google glass that utilized those object detection models
> in various ways.
