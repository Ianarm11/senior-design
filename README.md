### Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>
Our project goal is to create a generalized framework for creating a covert channel of communication and provide a working example of one.

Covert channels are a major threat to software systems, yet upon researching them, there are more resources on how to detect them than on how to build them. We believe that for cyber-security engineers to be able to stop system exploits from covert channels then they need to understand how they are built.

### User Stories <a name="user-stories"></a>
* As a hacker, I want to design a covert channel based on the framework, to save time.
* As a hacker, I want to refer to the framework when designing my covert channel, to have guidance.
* As a government official, I want to be capable of transmitting information in a covert channel, to prevent detection.
* As a cyber security analysis, I want to learn from this framework, to help detect covert channels.
