### Project Description <a name="project-description"></a>
Our project goal is to create a generalized framework for creating a covert channel of communication and provide a working example of one.

Covert channels are a major threat to software systems, yet upon researching them, there are more resources on how to detect them than on how to build them. We believe that for cyber-security engineers to be able to stop system exploits from covert channels then they need to understand how they are built.
